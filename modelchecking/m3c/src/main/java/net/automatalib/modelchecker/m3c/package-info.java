/**
 * This package (and sub-packages) provides the implementation of the model checker presented in the paper <a
 * href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-00244-2_15">M3C: Modal Meta Model Checking</a> by Bernhard Steffen and
 * Alnis Murtovi. The paper is based on <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/BFb0084787">Model Checking
 * for Context-Free Processes</a> by Olaf Burkart and Bernhard Steffen.
 * <p>
 * Note that this implementation requires a runtime dependency to a specific ADDLib backend (see
 * <a href="https://add-lib.scce.info/">https://add-lib.scce.info/</a>), which is not explicitly included in this
 * artifact due to packaging reasons.
