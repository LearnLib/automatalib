/**
 * A priority queue interface.
 * <p>
 * A priority queue is a queue which supports removal of the element with the minimal key value (wrt. natural ordering
 * or an explicitly specified {@link Comparator}).
 * <p>
 * This interface extends the functionality of the standard {@link PriorityQueue} in the way that it allows dynamic
 * behavior: The ordering of the elements in the queue is allowed to change. The only restriction is that whenever the
 * key which is used for comparison changes, the method {@link #keyChanged(ElementReference)} has to be called with the
 * reference of the respective element.
 *
 * @param <E>
 *         element class.
