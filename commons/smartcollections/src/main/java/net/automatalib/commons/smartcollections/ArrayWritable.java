/**
 * Unified interface for (collection) classes that allow writing their contents to an array. The intended behavior
 * differs from the standard Java {@link Collection#toArray(Object[])} method in the following way: <ul> <li>It is
 * possible to specify a source offset for this collection, i.e., how many elements are skipped before the target array
 * is written to. Note that if the collection does not define an iteration order, the set of elements which are omitted
 * is unspecified if {@code offset > 0}.</li> <li>It is possible to specify an offset for the destination array, i.e.,
 * at which position to begin writing into the destination array. <li>It is possible to specify the number of elements
 * to be written. Again, if this collection does not define an iteration order, the set of elements which are omitted if
 * {@code num < size()} is unspecified.</li> </ul>
 *
 * @param <T>
 *         type class. This is a marker parameter that is not reflected in the signatures, but can be respected by
 *         methods requiring type information.
