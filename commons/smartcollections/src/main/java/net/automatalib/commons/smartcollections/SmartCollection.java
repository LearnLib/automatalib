/**
 * An extended collection interface.
 * <p>
 * This interface overcomes various shortcomings of the {@link Collection} interface from the Java Collections
 * Framework, and also introduces other features not present in other libraries (such as the Apache Commons Collections
 * Library).
 * <p>
 * Efficiently operating on collections data structures is often hampered by the insufficient interface provided by the
 * standard Java collections.
 * <p>
 * For example, linked lists allow constant time removal if the element to be removed is known. However, using {@link
 * List#remove(int)} requires linear time in the provided parameter (and thus, in the worst case, linear time in the
 * size of the list). Removal in constant time is possible when iterating manually using the {@link Iterator#remove()}
 * method, but this is not only inconvenient, but also does not work if one wants to remove the elements later, because
 * {@link Iterator}s can't be cloned, and additionally are invalidated by other modifications of the underlying
 * collection during their existence.
 * <p>
 * This collection interface introduces a <i>reference</i> concept: References (represented by the marker interface
 * {@link ElementReference}) to the elements allow efficient (in terms of what the data structure itself supports)
 * operations on the elements, if the reference to the respective element is known. References can be acquired right at
 * the point when an element is added to the collection (using {@link #referencedAdd(Object)}), by explicitly searching
 * for an element (using {@link #find(Object)}) or during iteration (using the {@link #referenceIterator()} resp. {@link
 * #references()} method).
 * <p>
 * The validity of references is retained through all operations on the collection, except for those that cause removal
 * of the respective elements.
 *
