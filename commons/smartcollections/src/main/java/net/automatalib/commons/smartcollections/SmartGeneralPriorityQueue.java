/**
 * A generalized priority queue which allows storing arbitrary elements that don't have to be comparable, neither by
 * their natural ordering nor by a provided {@link Comparator}. Instead, keys can be assigned to the elements
 * explicitly.
 * <p>
 * Since this interface extends the {@link SmartCollection} (and thus also the {@link Collection}) interface, it has to
 * provide the {@link SmartCollection#referencedAdd(Object)} and {@link Collection#add(Object)} methods with no
 * additional key parameters. This is handled by using a <i>default key</i>, which is implicitly used for all elements
 * inserted using the above methods. Initially, the default key is <code>null</code>, whereas the <code>null</code> key
 * is by convention larger than any non-<code>null</code> key. The default key for consequent insertions can be changed
 * by calling {@link #setDefaultKey(Comparable)}.
 *
 * @param <E>
 *         element class.
 * @param <K>
 *         key class.
