/**
 * An interface for mapping objects of a certain domain type to objects of a certain range type.
 * <p>
 * A mapping is very much like a {@link Map}, but the perspective is a different one: Whereas a map is a (particularly
 * finite) key/value collection, a mapping is more like a function: it does not support retrieval of all keys or values,
 * because it does not requires them to be stored at all. Instead, they can be calculated on the fly upon an invocation
 * of {@link #get(Object)}.
 *
 * @param <D>
 *         domain type.
 * @param <R>
 *         range type.
