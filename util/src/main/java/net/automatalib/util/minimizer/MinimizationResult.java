/**
 * The result structure of a minimization process. The result of a minimization process is a partition on the original
 * set of states. This is represented by a collection of {@link Block}s containing states that are equivalent and thus
 * can be merged.
 * <p>
 * Since all states in a block are equivalent (and thus especially have the same set of outgoing edge labels), a
 * minimized automaton can be created from this partition by instantiating a state for each block. The edges between
 * those states are created in the following way: For each state/block, an original state is chosen arbitrarily from
 * this block. The edges are created according to the edges of this state, only that they point to the states
 * representing the blocks the respective target states belong to (using {@link #getBlockForState(Object)}).
 * <p>
 * The blocks in the result partition are guaranteed to have contiguous IDs (see {@link Block#getId()}), starting at 0.
 * This allows an efficient construction of the resulting automaton.
 * <p>
 * A more convenient way to obtain a representation of the resulting, minimized automaton is using a {@link
 * BlockAutomaton}.
