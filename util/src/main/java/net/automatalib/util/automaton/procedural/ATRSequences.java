/**
 * A data class for aggregating access sequences, terminating sequences, and return sequences.
 * <p>
 * An access sequence of a procedure is an input word that guarantees to transition a procedural system from its initial
 * state to the initial state of the respective procedure.
 * <p>
 * A terminating sequence of a procedure is an input word that guarantees to transition the respective procedure from
 * its initial state to an accepting state. The terminating sequence may contain nested invocations to other
 * procedures.
 * <p>
 * A terminating sequence of a procedure is an input word that guarantees to transition the procedural system from an
 * accepting state of the respective procedure to an accepting state of the procedural system, given that the procedure
 * has been reached by the corresponding access sequence.
