/**
 * This package contains the basic interfaces for automata.
 * <p>
 * An automaton (in the AutomataLib context) is a finite-state {@link net.automatalib.ts.TransitionSystem transition
 * system}. Like transition systems, automata are in general nondeterministic, but can be specialized to be {@link
 * net.automatalib.automata.DeterministicAutomaton deterministic}.
 * <p>
 * The {@link net.automatalib.automata.Automaton Automaton} interface has no inherent semantics. Special types of
 * automata, such as {@link net.automatalib.automata.fsa.DFA DFAs} or {@link net.automatalib.automata.transducers.MealyMachine
 * Mealy machines} can be found in the respective subpackages.
