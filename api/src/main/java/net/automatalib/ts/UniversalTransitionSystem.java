/**
 * A "universal" transition system, which captures the possibility to assign properties to states and transitions.
 * <p>
 * Generally speaking, these properties capture characteristics which are in general observable from the outside, but
 * not captured by the {@link TransitionSystem} interface. For example, neither is whether a state is initial or not a
 * state property, nor is a transition's successor a transition property.
 * <p>
 * A common example are finite state acceptors (FSAs), such as deterministic finite automata (DFAs). A state can be
 * accepting or non-accepting, thus the state property would likely be a {@link Boolean} signaling acceptance.
 * Transitions have are characterized by their successor state only, thus the transition property would most adequately
 * be realized by the {@link Void} class.
 * <p>
 * In contrast, in a Mealy Machine do not distinguish between accepting or rejecting states, but transitions generate
 * output symbols. The state property would therefore be {@link Void}, but the transition property would be the output
 * produced by this transition.
