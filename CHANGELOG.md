## [0.10.0-SNAPSHOT] - Unreleased

[Full changelog](https://github.com/LearnLib/automatalib/compare/automatalib-0.9.0...HEAD)

### Removed

* Removed `IOUtil#copy`, `IOUtil.skip`, `NullOutputStream`. Use the Guava equivalents from `ByteStreams` and `CharStreams`.


### Fixed

* Correctly enquote outputs containing whitespaces in `TAFWriter` ([#37](https://github.com/LearnLib/automatalib/issues/37), thanks to [Alexander Schieweck](https://github.com/aschieweck)).


## [0.9.0](https://github.com/LearnLib/automatalib/releases/tag/automatalib-0.9.0) - 2020-02-05

[Full changelog](https://github.com/LearnLib/automatalib/compare/automatalib-0.8.0...automatalib-0.9.0)

### Added

* A new alphabet implementation `MapAlphabet` that is based on the old `SimpleAlphabet` but without implementing the `GrowingAlphabet` interface.
* `IntRangeIterator` now implements `PrimitiveIterator.OfInt`.
* A parser for `dot` files has been added and is available in the `automata-serialization-dot` module via the `DOTParsers` factory.
* A new `PaigeTarjanMinimization` factory that offers convenience methods for PaigeTarjan-based automata minimization (with support for e.g. partial automata) has been added.
* Performance improvements for some alphabet implementations (`DefaultVPDAlphabet`, `ListAlphabet`, `{Int,Char}Range`, ...).
* An `LTSminLTLParser` to verify if LTL properties match the expected syntax of LTSmin.
* A `WordCollector` for collecting words from symbol `Stream`s.

### Changed

* Refactored the following packages/classes:
  * `net.automatalib.words.impl.SimpleAlphabet` -> `net.automatalib.words.impl.GrowingMapAlphabet`
  * `net.automatalib.serialization.AutomatonSerializationException` -> `net.automatalib.serialization.FormatException`
  * `net.automatalib.serialization.fsm.parser.FSMParseException` -> `net.automatalib.serialization.fsm.parser.FSMFormatException`
  * `net.automatalib.serialization.taf.parser.TAFParseException` -> `net.automatalib.serialization.taf.parser.TAFFormatException`
  * `net.automatalib.automata.transducers.impl.map.SimpleMapGraph` -> `net.automatalib.graphs.map.SimpleMapGraph`
* The `BackedGeneralPriorityQueue(Class<T> c)` constructor was replaced with a more idiomatic `BackedGeneralPriorityQueue(Supplier<T> s)` constructor.
* The TAF serialization code now forwards (i.e. `throws`) `IOException`s that occur when reading from the various data sources.
* JSR305 annotations have been replaced with checker-framework annotations.
  * AutomataLib now follows checker-framework's convention that (non-annotated) types are usually considered non-null unless explicitly annotated with `@Nullable`.
  * AutomataLib no longer has a (runtime-) dependency on JSR305 (and other `javax.*`) annotations or includes them in the distribution artifact. This now makes AutomataLib compliant with [Oracle's binary code license](https://www.oracle.com/downloads/licenses/binary-code-license.html) and allows AutomataLib artifacts as-is to be bundled in binary distributions with Oracle's JDKs/JREs.

### Removed

* `StringIndexGenerator` has been removed. Its (streamlined) functionality is now available as `Mapping` via `Mappings#stringToIndex` and `Mappings#indexToString`.
* `DelegatingIterator`: If you used this class, switch to Guavas equivalent `ForwardingIterator`.
* `ParameterMismatchException`: Was unused and never thrown.
* `StateIDDynamicMapping`: Equivalent functionality is provided by `ArrayMapping`.
* `ResizingIntArray`: Internal data structure was unused.
* The `VPDAlphabet` interface no longer specifies the `get{Internal,Call,Return}Symbols()` methods, as the `get{Internal,Call,Return}Alphabet()` methods supersede their functionality.
* `PaigeTarjan{Initializers,Extractors}` methods for non `IntAbstraction`s have been removed. You may use the new convenience methods provided by `PaigeTarjanMinimization`.
* Further `@Deprecated` methods have been removed.
* Removed `ProbMealyTransition` and replaced it with the generic `MealyTransition` directly carrying the `ProbabilisticOutput`. It is no longer allowed to pass `null` as transition property.
* Removed `OutputAndLocalInputs`, `StateLocalInputIncrementalMealyTreeBuilder` and `StateLocalInputMealyUtil`. The (LearnLib) code related to inferring partial Mealy machines no longer requires these transformed automata. Whoever used this code for transforming a partial Mealy machine to a complete one, may use `MealyMachines#complete` instead.


### Fixed

* Fixed a bug, where the PaigeTarjan-based minimization would return a wrong automaton when pruning was enabled and the initial automaton was partial.
* Fixed a bug in our Tarjan SCC implementation ([#35](https://github.com/LearnLib/automatalib/pull/35), thanks to [Malte Mues](https://github.com/mmuesly))
* Fixed a bug in the computation of characterizing sets ([#36](https://github.com/LearnLib/automatalib/issues/36)).
* Several (null-related) bugs detected by our ongoing efforts to write tests.


## [0.8.0](https://github.com/LearnLib/automatalib/releases/tag/automatalib-0.8.0) - 2019-02-07

[Full changelog](https://github.com/LearnLib/automatalib/compare/automatalib-0.7.1...automatalib-0.8.0)

### Added

* Added support for model checking automata using the [LTSmin](https://github.com/utwente-fmt/ltsmin) model checker (thanks to [Jeroen Meijer](https://github.com/Meijuh)).
* Added a `CompactMoore` implementation.
* Added an `AutomatonBuilder` for Moore Machines.
* Added support for adding input symbols to incremental constructions (tree caches, DAG caches).
* Support for Java 11. **Note:** AutomataLib still targets Java 8, and thus needs classes provided by this environment (specifically: annotations from `javax.annotation`). If you plan to use AutomataLib in a Java 11+ environment, make sure to provide these classes. They are not shipped with AutomataLib.

### Changed

* Refactored the following packages/classes:
  * `net.automatalib.automata.transout` -> `net.automatalib.automata.transducers`
  * `net.automatalib.ts.transout` -> `net.automatalib.ts.output`
  * `net.automatalib.util.automata.transout` -> `net.automatalib.util.automata.transducers`
  * `net.automatalib.automata.GrowableAlphabetAutomaton` -> `net.automatalib.SupportsGrowingAlphabet`
* Some runtime properties for dynamically configuring AutomataLib have been renamed. There now exists the `AutomataLibProperty` enum as a single reference point for all available properties.
* Several of the `AbstractCompact*` automata classes have been refactored to share common functionality. While this shouldn't affect its implementations (such as `CompactDFA` or `CompactMealy`) user-land code using the abstract classes may break.
* The `BricsDFA` wrapper previously allowed (via a boolean flag) to trigger determinization of the BRICS automaton. This determinization is now performed automatically if necessary. Instead the boolean flag now triggers a totalization of the transition function, which allows to properly use `BricsDFA`s in structural equivalence tests (as BRICS automata do not allow to limit their input alphabet to certain characters).
* Adding new symbols to automata (via the `SupportsGrowingAlphabet` interface) now requires the automaton to be initialized with a `GrowingAlphabet` instance. This is to make sure that the user has full control over which alphabet instance should be used instead of AutomataLib making decisions on behalf of the user.


### Removed

* The mutable `Pair` class has been removed. The previously immutable pair class `IPair` has been renamed to `Pair`.
* Some utility classes and functions (especially from the `automata-common-util` package) have been removed without replacement, since equivalent functionality is provided by the Google Guava library we depend on. If you used any of this code, switch to the Guava equivalent.
* `RichArray` has been removed. At least regarding storage, `ArrayStorage` can be used as a replacement.
* `SymbolHidingAlphabet` has been removed without replacement. Changes to the logic of adding new input symbols should no longer make this class necessary.

### Fixed

* Serializers now use platform dependent newlines. This shouldn't affect deserialization code.
* Several bugs detected either by our ongoing efforts to write tests.


## [0.7.1](https://github.com/LearnLib/automatalib/releases/tag/automatalib-0.7.1) - 2018-05-11

[Full changelog](https://github.com/LearnLib/automatalib/compare/automatalib-0.7.0...automatalib-0.7.1)

### Added

* Added `SymbolHidingAlphabet`, which is required for a bugfix release of LearnLib.

### Fixed

* Fixed an issue where initial states were not copied in copy-constructor of NFAs.
* Fixed an NPE when traversing partially defined NFAs.
* Fixed an issue, where input alphabets were unnecessarily wrapped in `SimpleAlphabet`s in compact automata implementations.
* Fixed an out-of-bounds error in incremental automata builders.
* Fixed an error in Paige/Tarjan algorithm for partially defined automata.
* Fixed wrong computation of strongly connected components (see #21).
* General consolidations (typos, wrong documentation, etc.).


## [0.7.0](https://github.com/LearnLib/automatalib/releases/tag/automatalib-0.7.0) - 2018-02-07

[Full changelog](https://github.com/LearnLib/automatalib/compare/automatalib-0.6.0...automatalib-0.7.0)

### Added

* Added algorithms for computing adaptive distinguishing sequences for Mealy machines.
* Added support for adding alphabet symbols after initial automaton construction.
* Added support for Visibly Push-Down Automata (VPDA) in form of 1-SEVPAs.
* Added (de-)serializers for the AUT format (see [#14](https://github.com/LearnLib/automatalib/issues/14)).
* Added lazy (iterator based) methods for computing state- and transition covers, W-Method and Wp-Method tests.
* Added a serializer for the SAF format.

### Changed

* Refactored the Maven artifact and Java package structure. Have a look at the [List of AutomataLib Artifacts](https://github.com/LearnLib/automatalib/wiki/List-of-AutomataLib-Artifacts) for an updated overview of available artifacts. In general, no functionality should have been removed (except of code marked with `@Deprecated`). The easiest way to migrate your code to the new version is probably by using the Auto-Import feature of your IDE of choice.

  The non-trivial refactorings include:
  * API methods no longer use wildcards in generic return parameters. This allows your code to not having to deal with them.
  * The visualization facade has been generified. Any `getGraphDOTHelper()` related code has been renamed to the more general `getVisualizationHelper()` terminology. The `Visualization` class now works by providing either the `automata-dot-visualizer` or `automata-jung-visualizer` JAR at runtime. This allows for potentially more visualizers in the future.

* Replaced `System.out` logging, with calls to an SLF4j facade.
* Code improvements due to employment of several static code-analysis plugins (findbugs, checkstyle, PMD, etc.) as well as setting up continuous integration at [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/LearnLib/automatalib).

### Removed

* Several classes and methods annotated with `@Deprecated`.

### Fixed

* Several bugs detected either by our newly employed static code-analysis toolchain or by our ongoing efforts to write tests.
