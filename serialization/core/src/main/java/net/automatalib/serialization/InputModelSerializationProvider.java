/**
 * A utility interface that unions {@link InputModelSerializer} and {@link InputModelDeserializer} and extends {@link
 * SerializationProvider}.
 * <p>
 * This interface allows to specify two independent types (one for serialization, one for de-serialization) which allows
 * implementing classes to specify types more precise. This may be useful if the respective types hold generics as well
 * (which are invariant).
 *
 * @param <I>
 *         the input symbol type
 * @param <OUT>
 *         The type of objects that should be serialized
 * @param <IN>
 *         The type of objects that should be de-serialized
