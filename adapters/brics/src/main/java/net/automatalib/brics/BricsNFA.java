 * Adapter class for wrapping a Brics automaton as an {@link NFA}.

 * This adapter is backed by the Brics automaton, so changes to the {@link Automaton} are reflected.

 * As a DFA can be regarded as a special case of an NFA, using this class on a Brics {@link Automaton} will always work.
 * However, determining successor states for input characters might be much less efficient than when using a {@link
 * BricsDFA}.
